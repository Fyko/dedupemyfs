# dedupemyfs
> A CLI tool to detect duplicate files in a directory tree

I was in an interview recently where the interviewer mentioned having a personal project doing just this.
I thought it would be a *fun* way to learn C. How incredibly wrong I was.


## Usage
- build with `make`
- run with ./dedupemyfs in the dir you want to scan
- output will list the file hash and the files that have the same hash
